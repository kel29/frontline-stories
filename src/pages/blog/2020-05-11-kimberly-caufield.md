My mom is a clerk at a Trader Joe's in North Carolina, and is still considered an essential worker. She is not allowed to wear gloves because she was told it might "scare the customers." She is permitted a mask but there's social pressure not to wear it in the store. She can't take more than 20 days off because she'll lose her benefits, and she couldn't afford to take the time regardless because she needs the income. My mom is also immune compromised and not old, but older.
